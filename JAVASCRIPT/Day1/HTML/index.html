    1: Create a variable that stores your name and log a string to the console
    that greets you using template literals. 2: Create Variables storing your
    name, your age and your favourite film or tv series. Using template literals
    I want you to log a sentence including these values to the console. 3:
    Generate a number between 1 and 50 and log it to the console. 4: Create
    variables storing what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday and
    a log a sentence to the console. Without overwriting the initial variable
    declarations I would like you to set new variable values to what you have
    eaten / plan to eat today and log another sentence to the console.
