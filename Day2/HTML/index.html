    Tasks: 1: Write an if statement that checks whether a customer is old enough
    to be served alcohol at a bar. Declare a variable called age and write an if
    statement that checks whether age is 18 or above. If age is less than 18 log
    "Sorry, I can't serve you" to the console, if age is 18 or above log "No
    problem, what would you like to drink?" 2: Declare a variable called
    "Password". Write an if statement that checks how many characters are in the
    password, if the password has more than 8 characters log the password to the
    console, if the password has less than 8 characters log to the console that
    the password is too short. 3: Create a variable that stores a number. Check
    whether the number is divisible by 3 or 5, if so log "This number is
    divisible by 3 or 5" to the console. Otherwise log an alternate message to
    the console. 4: Create a variable that stores a number. If the number is
    divisible by 3, if so log "fizz" to the console. If the number is divisible
    by 5 log "buzz" to the console. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5,
    log "fizz buzz" to the console. Otherwise log the number to the console.
    Stretch Task: Create variable that stores a number. Check if the number is a
    palindrome.
